Shmup: my iLander assignment for the C# course.

Shmup is a game where your a space janitor tasked with cleaning out the rocks.

In Shmup your spaceship is outfitted with a old blaster thats gets heated up as you progress
and in turn will fire faster and faster for every stage you complete (up to level 3). Your ship wont get damaged by the rocks, so you could just skip your work and go to the end but will have to travers the maze of rocks (whose placement is always random) to get there, so blasting them is the best way through. 

To play Shmup you need to download the github repository and install the Input System and TextMeshPro packages then open the Main Menu scene and start the game.

my thought process for the different part of the game was that they should only have what they need.
Player holds only the ability to shoot and move, the rocks hold the random position and their health the UI holds the buttons and the pause function and for the bullets I made them into a pool as they would effect the games performance otherwise.

my inspiration for this was old game i made way back going by "Having Great Adventure", sadly its unavailable online but i used some old gifs of it in my application to futuregames.
